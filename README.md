## Inventory Management System

A centralized Inventory Management System designed to help retailers efficiently manage products, inventory levels, supplier coordination, and consumer availability, while providing analytics, audit monitoring, and multi-store support.

The system connects **Retailers, Suppliers, Consumers, POS systems, and Administrators** into a single integrated platform to improve stock visibility, reduce stockouts, and optimize supply chain operations.

## Problem Statement

Retail businesses often face challenges such as:

- Inaccurate inventory tracking
- Overstocking or frequent stockouts
- Poor supplier coordination
